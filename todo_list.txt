No need for launcher
If using engine-solo, unlikely to be playing more than one game at a time. Even so, if multiple .ltproj files detected by engine, prompt you to choose before playing.
editor doesn't need launcher -- just open projects from File Menu.
Have the editor auto-check for updates on launch. It then spawns a process to download and install and closes itself.
Maybe: Have any built games check for updates to the engine in the extras menu. Click Check for Updates, if so, will ask you to to proceed, if so, closes self and auto-updates. 
Maybe: Executable versions of the editor and engine work the same way, they just check from a different source.
