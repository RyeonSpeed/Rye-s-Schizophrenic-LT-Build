# Remaining Priorities
```
Auras
    - Auras have a instantiated child aura they keep a reference to. Works like child items in the item system
    - Aura board keeps track of where the aura_child belongs
    - Aura board is updated on arrive and leave
    - Within the skill system, the skill system calls up the aura children
    - Needs to be able to handle ally auras and enemy auras
    ```
        for aura_uid in game.board.get_auras(unit.team, unit.position):
            aura = game.get_skill(aura_uid)
            if aura.defines('??'):
                # Do the thing
    ```
Sequence Items (Warp, Rescue, Ember, Crazier stuff)
test Multi Items for the AI

Multi-items 
    Work as activated items
Test Warp, Rescue and all other items from Sacred Stones

Clean and Rename files/resources button in Help
Auto-check cross-references on editor load

Consider making StatList and WeaponList into a dictionary instead, that just references the actual order in DB.stats and DB.weapons to display order, and then uses the dictionary keys to display contents/values.

Consider giving each object a UID which is used for crossreferences... (This is probably the better way...)

Test First 5 chapters of Sacred Stones

Customizable stat screen within Info Menu
Customizable item screen (to handle accessories...) within Info Menu

Once StatList and Weapon List are fixed:
    Weapon Level increment by weapon level ranks
    Copy rows of stats and paste rows of stats

unload_unit

== Maybe, maybe not: ==
Klok's Combining items idea
" imagine that, when you select an item, an arrow appears on its left and the item would 'highlight'
then when you select the next item, it also highlights with an arrow, followed by a preview of their combined effects to the right/left, and a "Press A to attack" box"

- Yeti-style stat averages: Units start off when you recruit them with yellow stats, and the stats will shift to red or green depending on how they perform when leveling up. Example: If a unit should average 10 speed at level 15, and they have 10 speed, their SPD stat will be yellow. If instead they have 15 speed, their SPD stat will be green because they overperformed. If it's only 5, the SPD stat will be red because they underperformed.

Resources -- Show in explorer (maybe)...

    Position in main info menu setters
