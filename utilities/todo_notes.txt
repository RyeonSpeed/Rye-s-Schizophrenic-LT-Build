TODO List:

Get rid of on_add and on_remove
Save needs to pull up Progress Bar -- Dialog box should pop up when saving and autosaving
Speed up serialization
Figure out whether we should be saving music and sound effects the way we ARE saving them...

Clean and Rename files/resources button in Help
Auto-check cross-references on editor load

Consider giving each object a UID which is used for crossreferences... (This is probably the better way...)

Customizable stat screen within Info Menu
Customizable item screen (to handle accessories...) within Info Menu

Klok's Combining items idea
" imagine that, when you select an item, an arrow appears on its left and the item would 'highlight'
then when you select the next item, it also highlights with an arrow, followed by a preview of their combined effects to the right/left, and a "Press A to attack" box"

- Yeti-style stat averages: Units start off when you recruit them with yellow stats, and the stats will shift to red or green depending on how they perform when leveling up. Example: If a unit should average 10 speed at level 15, and they have 10 speed, their SPD stat will be yellow. If instead they have 15 speed, their SPD stat will be green because they overperformed. If it's only 5, the SPD stat will be red because they underperformed.
