TODO List:
Turnwheel bug. Sometimes when turnwheeling back a unit who moved but didn't end up doing anything after moving, when turnwheeled back they end up with movement_left move instead of full movement

Get rid of on_add and on_remove

Auto-check cross-references on editor load

Consider giving each object a UID which is used for crossreferences... (This is probably the better way...)

Klok's Combining items idea
" imagine that, when you select an item, an arrow appears on its left and the item would 'highlight'
then when you select the next item, it also highlights with an arrow, followed by a preview of their combined effects to the right/left, and a "Press A to attack" box"

- Yeti-style stat averages: Units start off when you recruit them with yellow stats, and the stats will shift to red or green depending on how they perform when leveling up. Example: If a unit should average 10 speed at level 15, and they have 10 speed, their SPD stat will be yellow. If instead they have 15 speed, their SPD stat will be green because they overperformed. If it's only 5, the SPD stat will be red because they underperformed.
