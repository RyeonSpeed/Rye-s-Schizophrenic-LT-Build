# Engine design
Priority 1
input manager 
    - mouse control
    - mouse and joystick configurations
    - how do mouse controls itneract with cursor and menus
integration with editor
bitmap font
    - addition to resource editor
static random
music thread
pathfinding
imagesDict
    - better loading on the fly; Don't need to load EVERY resource until necessary
image_modification -- consider using indexed images since its so much faster
engine
main
    - sets up game state
game state
    - singleton class that loads everything at the beginning and does the running
    - better handling with no current level (overworld, base)
    - better places to store temporary data that needs to be moved around between states
state machine
    - better start, begin, end, finish control
    - better use of "name" to register states with machine
map
    - make sure it works well
camera
    - separate class that handles camera with more control than previous hodgepodge
menus (make folder within engine)
    - better inheritance -- based off QT
    - make sure mouse control also works with menus
    - better handling of popups, scroll bars, counters, etc
    - help menu
cursor
    - separate class that better handles the cursor
    - mouse support as well
save/load
    - better saving and loading for current game -- no need for separate save slot class
    - where are saves stored
phase
    - Class that handles turn phase transition
items, units, classes
    - should all be handled better
stats
    - bonuses no longer added permanently -- now just loaded on the fly by querying status effects
actions
turnwheel
interaction
solver
health bar
level up
    - make a lot better
title screen
game over
state transitions
