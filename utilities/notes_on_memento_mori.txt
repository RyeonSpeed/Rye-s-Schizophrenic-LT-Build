Notes on Memento Mori
1. Different screen resolution
2. Runes
3. Alternative Skill method -- No RNG mode?
	No output RNG
	Each unit has a break bar with five slots
	Each attack done to a unit fills up the guard bar
	Weapon triangle is -1 Break, +1 Break
	Having 4 or more skill than opponents speed +1 Break, 8 or more skill +2 Break, etc.
	Attacks only deal damage if they break opponents bar
	Having 4 or more speed than opponents skill -1 Break, etc.
	how does doubling work?
	Breaking an opponents bar twice in one attack causes a Critical hit x2 damage + bonus (Heal, Break refresh, Galeforce)

Important considerations:
No output randomness
You choose the path -- lots of input randomness
Whole world is falling apart -- The world is ruined/old
Mechanics should be intuitive and deep
Simple is better than complex
Gameplay is more important than story
Characters are more important than the plot
Final goal should always be kept in mind
Customization should be rewarded
Growth is fun -- Growing your units is fun
Movement is deep and intuitive
Minimize dialogue
Story can be mysterious -- ill-formed
Characters have their own optional arcs
Grinding is discouraged
Permadeath can be reversed (Turnwheel)
Resource management should be incorporated
