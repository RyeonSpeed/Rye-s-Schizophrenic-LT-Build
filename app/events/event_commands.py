        """
Presents the player with a menu in which he/she can choose from several options. An example would be the choice to go with Eirika or Ephraim in The Sacred Stones.

The result of the selection is stored in the game_var `$(nid)` - e.g. `routesplit` for a choice with NID `routesplit`.

The current selection is stored in the game_var `$(nid)_choice_hover` - e.g. `routesplit_choice_hover` for a choice with NID `routesplit`.

The outcome of the previous choice dialog can be accessed in `_last_choice`.

* *Nid* is the name of this choice, which can be checked later to recall the player's decision.
* *Title* is the text describing the choice, such as "which will you choose?"
* *Choices* is one of two things. It can be a *StringList*, i.e. a list of string choices, or it can be a Python Expression, which refers to a list of string choices.
For example, `Eirika, Ephraim, Seth` would be a list of string choices. `[unit.nid for unit in game.get_units_in_party()]` is an expression that would evaluate to `Eirika, Ephraim, Seth`.
What is the difference? The Python Expression will be constantly updated, which means that if the party changes, the choices will automatically change as well.

**NOTE: Use the flags to determine the correct type.**

**NOTE:** You can use the `|` delimiter to mark a distinction between the nid of a choice, and the text of a choice, if the nid is not meant to be read.
For example, suppose you give the player a choice between two klasses, and these klasses are called ArmorKnight\_Sun and ArmorKnight\_Moon. Obviously, you don't
want the player to be forced to read the weird nid. You can instead populate the choices like so:

`choice;ClassSelection;Choose Class; ArmorKnight_Sun|Solar Knight,ArmorKnight_Moon|Lunar Knight;...`

And the choice will use `Solar Knight` and `Lunar Knight` as its text.

Optional args:

* *RowWidth* allows you to specify the specific width of each row.
* The *Orientation* keyword specifies whether the options are displayed as a vertical list or side-by-side.
* The *Alignment* keyword specifies where on the screen the choice box will be displayed.
* *BG* specifies what base image to use as background. menu_bg images will be tiled, while other sprites will not.
* The *Event* keyword gives you the option to call an event on selection, if you should so choose. The new event will have the same args {unit}, {unit2} etc. as the current event.
* The *Type* keyword specifies the specific type of the options, and will change the way the entries are displayed.
* The *Dimensions* keyword allows you to specify the size of the list in `(rows, columns)`.
* The *TextAlign* keyword specifies the alignment of the choice text

* *type_skill* will interpret all options as skill NIDs
* *type_base_item* will interpret all options as item NIDs
* *type_game_item* will interpret all options as item UIDs (i.e. actual items in game - important if you want to distiguish between a 1/40 vs 40/40 Iron Sword, for example)
* *type_unit* will interpret all options as unit NIDs
* *type_class* will interpret all options as class NIDs.
* *type_icon* will use the following syntax: `iconsheetnid-iconx-icony-choicetext`, and will display the specific icon16 alongside the choice.
* *type_sprite* will interpret the options as sprite NIDs.

* The *persist* flag indicates whether or not the choice ends after you make a selection. If *persist* is true, then the choice can only be exited
via hitting the back button, and the event will go on as normal.

* The *expression* flag indicates that the provided table data should be be continually parsed as a python expression and updated.
* The *no_bg* flag removes the bg.
* *no_cursor* removes the cursor.
* *arrows* adds pulsing left/right arrows.
* *scroll_bar* adds a vertical scroll bar

a string or list of strings. For example, `game.get_money()` would resolve to the current amount of gold in the party. The difference between Expressions
